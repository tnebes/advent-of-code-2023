/*
   As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.

   the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.

   Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only:
   12 red cubes,
   13 green cubes,
   and 14 blue cubes.
   
   What is the sum of the IDs of those games?
